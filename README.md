This theme is largely based of KDE's default Breeze Dark. Honestly KDE's default themes look really good, I just wanted to customise a few things to better suit my needs such as having the colour scheme across all apps and plasma dektop components.

The wallpaper can be found here:

This theme also plays with different accent colours as I have not hardcoded a svg for plasma items. So please set your Accent colour to #cd7a8a or use your own to spice things up.

To install this theme you simply need to set the following settings in your KDE Appearance settings: 

.1  Colors - Here you need to select 'Lucent Pastel' which you placed in Home/.local/share/color-schemes
.2  Plasma Style - Select Lucent Pastel as the plasma style. This needs to be placed in Home/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme

All other items such as application style and window styles are based off Breeze Dark and are unmodified.

The Plasma style has a transparency effect set to it, unfortunately KDE's colours currently are borked and dont allow for opacity options so to get around this please set your Window Management/Window Rules to have Active Opacity and Incactive opacity settings for the applications you use. Please see screenshot below for opacity values.

Remember to set your Login Screen(SDDM) to use the provided wallpaper so you have a more cohesive look!

Disclaimer - This theme is not 100% completed, if you find any troubles with it please feel free to contribute or else let me know and I will try to make a fix for you.

Enjoy and if you ever use it please give some credit.
